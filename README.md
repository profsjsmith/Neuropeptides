# Regenerative neuropeptide signaling

This repo contains materials pertinent to three related posters: one presented at a Stanford meeting in 2025, one presented at the Dendrites Gordon Conference in Ventura CA in 2025 and one presented at the 2025 SfN annual meeting in San Diego.

The PDF file "Smith Stanford 2024.pdf" is a compressed version of the file from which the Stanford 2024 poster was printed.
The PDF file Smith_poster_GRC_2025.pdf is a compressed version of the file from which the Ventura 2025 poster was printed.
The PDF file Smith_poster_SfN_2025.pdf is a compressed version of the file from which the SfN 2025 poster was printed.

The ZIP archive “Scripts_and_helper_files” includes the JUPYTER notebook scripts and minor resource files used to generate all data graphics for the poster, “Evidence for Regenerative Neuropeptide Signaling in Cerebral Cortex”, displayed at  a Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Symposium, “Brains & Machines: The Co-Evolution of Neuroscience and AI”, on Thursday 17 October 2024.

The ZIP archive “Scripts_and_helper_files_GRC_2025” includes the JUPYTER notebook scripts and minor resource files used to generate all data graphics for the poster, “Evidence for Dense and Regenerative CCK Signaling Networks amongst Mouse Cortical Pyramidal Cells”, displayed at the Ventura Dendrites GRC on 24-25 March 2025.

The ZIP archive “Scripts_and_helper_files_SfN_2025” includes the JUPYTER notebook scripts and minor resource files used to generate all data graphics for the poster, “An Intriguing Puzzle of Cortical Cholecystokinin (CCK) Gene Expression”, displayed at the SfN Annual Meeting in San Diego on 17 Nov 2025.

These scripts are posted here in interests of scientific rigor and analysis documentation. These  scripts are definitely NOT ready for easy “load and go” execution. Execution of any would require extensive expert environment configuration and download of numerous large, publicly available primary data files, as described in publications cited on the poster and called out by the readme in the “Primary_scRNAseq_Data” sub-folders within the zip archives. Script execution and reproduction of the poster grapics should be possible for any experienced pythonic data scientist.

The PDF file “NP_net_predictions_20_regions_30_NP_pairs” is a 600 page document that displays one NP network adjacency matrix prediction for each of 20 regions of mouse isocortex and hippocampal formation and each of 30 NPP / cognate-NP-GPCR -aggregate pairs. It is a superset of the representative similar graphics dsiplayed on the poster.

The PDF file "Microbibliography" is a categorized list of references to 50 publications relevant to the subject matter of the poster.

The Volume EM renderings on the poster were generated using Neuroglancer (Maitin-Shepard, 2016: https://github.com/google/neuroglancer) to visualize MICrONS project volume EM data (MICrONS Consortium, 2023: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.454025v3). Please visit the MICrONS project website (https://www.microns-explorer.org/) for an introduction to the procedures involved.
