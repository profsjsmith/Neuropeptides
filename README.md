The ZIP archive “Scripts_and_helper_files” includes the JUPYTER notebook scripts and minor resource files used to generate all data graphics for the poster, “Evidence for Regenerative Neuropeptide Signaling in Cerebral Cortex”, displayed at  a Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Symposium, “Brains & Machines: The Co-Evolution of Neuroscience and AI”, on Thursday 17 October 2024.

These scripts are posted here in interests of scientific rigor and analysis documentation. These  scripts are definitely NOT ready for easy “load and go” execution. Execution of any would require extensive expert environment configuration and download of numerous large, publicly available primary data files, as described in publications cited on the poster and called out by the readme in the present “Primary_scRNAseq_Data” sub-folder.

The PDF file “Smith Stanford 2024” is the file from which the poster was printed.

The PDF file “NP_net_predictions_20_regions_30_NP_pairs” is a 600 page document that displays one NP network adjacency matrix prediction for each of 20 regions of mouse isocortex and hippocampal formation and each of 30 NPP / cognate-NP-GPCR -aggregate pairs. It is a superset of the representative similar graphics dsiplayed on the poster.

The PDF file "Microbibliography" is a categorized list of references to 50 publications relevant to the subject matter of the poster.
